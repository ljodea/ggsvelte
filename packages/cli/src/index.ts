 * The bin (bin/ggsvelte-render.js) wires process streams around
 * `runCLI`, which lives in @ggsvelte/core so the pipeline and the CLI
 * share one tested implementation. This entry re-exports that surface so
 * hosts embedding the CLI (test harnesses, sandbox runners) can call it
 * without spawning a process.
