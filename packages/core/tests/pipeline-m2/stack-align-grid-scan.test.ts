/**
 * The stacked-area auto-align rescue first asks whether any group skips a
 * shared-grid x inside its own range. It answered by walking the sorted grid
 * per group, and the "before this group starts" arm was a `continue` rather
 * than a seek, so every group paid for the whole prefix below its own minimum.
 *
 * Groups and distinct x both grow with the data, so that scan was
 * groups × grid-x. The shape it costs most on is the ordinary one: many series
 * that each cover a dense window of a wider shared grid and have no holes at
 * all — exactly the case where the answer is "no rescue needed".
