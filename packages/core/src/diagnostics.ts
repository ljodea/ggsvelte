/**
 * The core diagnostics surface — render-time errors, warnings, and advisories
 * (M3 error-catalog audit). Error *prose* for pipeline codes lives in
 * @ggsvelte/spec (`PIPELINE_ERROR_CATALOG`, #987); this package re-exports it
 * and owns warnings, advisories, CLI diagnostics, and every emission site.
 * Catalog completeness is primary via typed emission registries
 * (`diagnostics-emission-registry.ts`, #628). Dual-channel rich diagnostics
 * project lean + rich from structured facts in `pipeline/diagnostics-emit.ts`
 * — never by parsing human-readable messages.
 *
 * Large tables:
 * - diagnostics-error-catalog.ts — re-exports PIPELINE_ERROR_CATALOG from spec
 * - diagnostics-warning-catalog.ts — PIPELINE_WARNING_CATALOG
 * - diagnostics-emission-registry.ts — checked catalog↔emission membership
 * This file keeps advisories, CLI diagnostics, and re-exports the public surface.
 *
 * Naming note: `palette-exhausted` appears as BOTH an error and a warning by
 * design (the palette-exhaustion contract): the default `onExhaust: "cycle"`
 * emits the warning; opt-in `onExhaust: "error"` throws the error.
 * `stat-channel-unsupported` is likewise dual-channel: style bindings throw
 * the error; color/fill bindings warn and ignore the mapping (#915 / #1043).
 * `max-marks-exceeded` exists as a PipelineError (renderToSVGString) and a CLI
 * diagnostic (the CLI's own --max-marks check).
