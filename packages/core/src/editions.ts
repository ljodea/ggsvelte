/**
 * Defaults editions (Hadley lesson 13: fix accumulated bad defaults "without
 * breaking existing code").
 *
 * `normalize()` (in @ggsvelte/spec) stamps `edition: CURRENT_EDITION` onto
 * every spec that does not already carry one, freezing which generation of
 * DEFAULT aesthetics the spec was authored against. This module is the other
 * half of the mechanism: the pipeline resolves its default theme table,
 * default categorical palette, and default sequential ramp THROUGH the spec's
 * edition, so a future edition can ship better defaults while every stamped
 * spec keeps its original look. Explicit settings (spec.theme, scales.*.range,
 * scales.*.scheme) always win over edition defaults.
 *
 * There is no global mutable registry (Hadley lesson 14): the edition table is
 * frozen, and callers who need to extend it (tests proving the mechanism; a
 * future edition-2 rollout) pass a table via `RunOptions.editions`, scoped to
 * the run.
 *
 * Unknown editions (a spec stamped by a NEWER ggsvelte than the one rendering
 * it) fall back to the latest edition this build knows, and the pipeline emits
 * an `unknown-edition` warning — old renderers degrade to their best defaults
 * instead of failing.
