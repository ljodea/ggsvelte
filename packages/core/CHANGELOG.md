# @ggsvelte/core

## 0.5.1

### Patch Changes

- 85f5b5a: <!-- markdownlint-disable MD041 -->

  Map scale-diagnostic severity onto the CLI stderr `kind` field 1:1 so error-severity diagnostics emit `kind: "error"` instead of being demoted to `warning`.

- Updated dependencies [85f5b5a]
  - @ggsvelte/spec@0.5.1

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 78c1942: # Temporal guide plans

  Add measured temporal axis plans with calendar-aligned automatic breaks, contextual and complete labels, explicit interval/minor-break controls, locale/timezone formatting, stable diagnostics, and per-panel `RenderModel.guidePlans` inspection.

  Migration: none — additive

### Patch Changes

- 087a4b1: <!-- markdownlint-disable MD041 -->

  Point published package metadata at the live documentation site and identify each package's monorepo directory.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- cfafdd1: # Temporal scale semantics

  Add strict, value-driven date and datetime scales across PortableSpec, fluent builder, and Svelte authoring. Raw four-digit year strings now infer a proportional UTC calendar axis after whole-column validation; ambiguous date orders and identifier-like values remain discrete until explicitly configured.

  Add deterministic named, exact-format, epoch, timezone, and DST-disambiguation parsers; parser-keyed immutable table views; structured scale decisions and diagnostics; ggplot2-style scale aliases; and lubridate-style authoring helpers. Preserve original source values for interactions while using semantic epoch values before stats, positions, scale training, and rendering.

  Migration: <https://ljodea.github.io/ggsvelte/guide/temporal-scales>

  If a four-digit string field is an identifier rather than a calendar year, set the position scale to `type: "band"`, call `scaleXDiscrete()` / `scaleYDiscrete()`, or use the equivalent snake_case alias. Ambiguous DMY/MDY input now requires an explicit parser such as `parse: "dmy"` or `parse: "mdy"`.

### Patch Changes

- 32c207a: # CLI reference parity

  Keep renderer CLI parsing, help output, and generated reference metadata backed by one option definition.

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 8b7d672: # Report the installed CLI version

  Add the `ggsvelte-render --version` runner contract while preserving SVG-only stdout and JSON Lines diagnostics for render commands.

- 437ff12: # Enforce theme and palette compatibility

  Reject named color schemes that do not match their ordinal or sequential scale type, and reject unsupported custom color syntax before rendering. When `type` is omitted, a named scheme now selects its ordinal or sequential family instead of being silently ignored or misused. Custom ranges accept `#rgb` and `#rrggbb`; three-digit stops normalize to lowercase six-digit hex so sequential interpolation cannot emit malformed colors.

  Migration: replace categorical schemes on sequential scales with `viridis` or a custom hex range; replace `viridis` on ordinal scales with a categorical scheme or custom hex range. Replace named or functional CSS colors in `scales.color.range` and `scales.fill.range` with equivalent `#rgb` or `#rrggbb` values.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- b8dcf24: # Use CandidateStore for all hit resolution

  Add paint-ordered `CandidateStore.hitTest()` and route Svelte pointer inspection
  through the render model's existing lazy candidate index. Remove the experimental
  `buildHitIndex` and related `@ggsvelte/core/dom` types so interactive plots no
  longer build and retain a second geometry index.

  Migration: <https://ljodea.github.io/ggsvelte/guide/upgrading#0-2-to-0-3>

- e4b02b5: # Delegate keyboard navigation to CandidateStore

  Let `CandidateStore.traverse()` apply modular sequential steps and preserve
  paint order for directional ties. Svelte inspection now delegates sequential,
  directional, and coincident keyboard navigation to the model-owned store
  without materializing a second candidate traversal list.

  Migration: <https://ljodea.github.io/ggsvelte/guide/upgrading#0-2-to-0-3>

### Patch Changes

- 30db776: # Deepen Candidate construction

  Consolidate source-backed and identity-indexed Candidate construction behind one pipeline module seam while preserving CandidateStore behavior and performance contracts.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- ce685ea: # Add linked interactive legend focus

  Add opt-in pointer, touch, and keyboard legend controls; stable-key emphasis
  propagation; renderer-neutral focus masks with SVG/canvas parity; 24-pixel
  legend targets; typed events and diagnostics; and a three-view example.

  Migration: none — additive

- 70b1070: # Add precise filtering and faceted intervals

  Filter discrete legend groups without changing their color identity, coordinate
  durable interval selections across facets with independent, union, or
  cross-panel semantics, and enter exact accessible selection or zoom bounds for
  linear, log, time, reversed, and band scales.

  Migration: none — additive

### Patch Changes

- f171d83: # Performance and hardening backfill

  Changelog backfill for the performance, bug-fix, and internal-architecture work
  merged between v0.1.1 and this release that did not carry individual
  changesets.

  Performance:

  - Stroked-path hit-testing resolves candidates through an edge AABB shortlist
    (O(log E + k) instead of scanning every edge).
  - Canvas segment strokes batch mirror points and render in Θ(runs); canvas
    accessibility rows are not materialised while the data table is closed.
  - Selection membership checks use parallel `Set`s (O(1) per key), and
    non-union interval walks fuse with a shared candidate projection.
  - Many further allocation and traversal reductions across scales, legends,
    facets, tooltips, and interaction controllers.

  Fixes:

  - Keyed `seedId` pin rebinds require a role match.
  - Legend filter chrome honors `--gg-tooltip-background` and preserves
    contrast; forced-colors paint is deterministic for disabled-at-SSR tool
    buttons.
  - Restored interval selections no longer hit an SSR temporal-dead-zone error.
  - Annotation frames stay rowless for `inputGroups`.

  Internals: source modules were split into smaller single-concern units
  (validate, normalize, error catalog, controllers) with no public API change.
