/**
 * Guide channel types + splitChannel for declaration-only guide shells
 * (#659 slice 6). Registration lives in {@link createPlotLayer} (#786).
 *
 * Guides are keyed by AESTHETIC, so this family is five type shells that each
 * take a `channel` prop — not a 5×9 codegen matrix. The aesthetic is the key,
 * never part of the helper: `<GuideLegend channel="color" position="bottom"/>`
 * assembles `guides: { color: { type: "legend", position: "bottom" } }`.
 *
 * guides is a keyed-MERGE family, but the VALUE at a key is replaced whole —
 * `builder.guides` shallow-merges by channel, so a child never field-merges
 * into a prop's guide object.
