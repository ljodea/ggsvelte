 * Positional source edits (#659 slice 7).

 * ranges and inserts child elements, so the whole requirement is "apply
 * non-overlapping [start, end) replacements to the original string" — 20 lines
 * that keep `@ggsvelte/svelte` free of a runtime dependency consumers would
 * install forever to run a tool once.
 *
 * Applying right-to-left is what makes earlier offsets stay valid, which is
 * why every offset in the caller can come straight from the parse tree.
