/**
 * Test 13: every DEPRECATION_DIAGNOSTIC_CATALOG docUrl anchor resolves against
 * the rendered upgrading guide. The deprecation-wiring test only walks JSDoc;
 * this guards the runtime docUrl anchors that ship on live advisories.
 *
 * Runs under the root bun test suite (scripts + package tests) via a thin
 * re-export in scripts/ — actually this file is under packages/svelte/tests
 * and runs with vitest. Anchor resolution needs the guide renderer from
 * scripts/, so the authoritative check lives in scripts/deprecation-catalog-anchors.test.ts.
