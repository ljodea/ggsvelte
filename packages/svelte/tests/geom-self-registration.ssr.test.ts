/**
 * Seam C (#1420): component self-registration, isolated.
 *
 * This file lives in the SSR lane on purpose: the browser lane has a
 * lane-wide registerAll() setup (tests/setup-register-all.ts) that would
 * mask the behavior under test. Vitest's per-file isolate gives this file a
 * fresh registry — GGPlot brings only basic geoms/stats and interaction
 * candidates, and the GeomSmooth import alone must register its stat + geom.
 *
 * DO NOT add a registerAll() setup to the SSR lane; it would silently mask
 * this seam.
