/**
 * The repo composes its own charts the way it tells consumers to (#659 slices
 * 8 and 9).
 *
 * 0.11.0 deprecated the seven grammar props on `<GGPlot>` (facet, coord,
 * scales, guides, legend, theme, labs) in favour of declaration-only child
 * layers, and shipped `ggsvelte-codemod` to migrate them. Documentation that
 * still passes them is the loudest possible counter-argument, so this asserts
 * two surfaces are on the child form: the docs app's own Svelte sources plus
 * the getting-started page the guide builds line by line (slice 8), and every
 * Svelte fence in the guide itself (slice 9).
 *
 * For the sources, the check IS the codemod: a file is migrated when running
 * it over that file rewrites nothing (`changes`) and refuses nothing
 * (`skipped`). Reusing the shipped transform rather than a bespoke regex means
 * the guard cannot drift from what `npx ggsvelte-codemod` would tell a reader
 * to do. Guide fences are matched textually instead, because most of them are
 * deliberately incomplete and would not parse.
