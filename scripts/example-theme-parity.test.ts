/**
 * Every example describes itself twice: spec.ts (the PortableSpec the docs
 * "Builder"/"Spec" tabs are built from) and Example.svelte (what the gallery
 * actually renders). Data, aes and labs have always been hand-duplicated that
 * way, but `theme` is the one attribute where drift is visible: the gallery
 * would render one theme while Spec JSON shows another.
 *
 * So the duplication is allowed, but it is not allowed to disagree. Guard for
 * #656, which is the first change to make theme load-bearing in examples/**.
 *
 * Theme is declared as a declaration-only child (`<ThemeDark />`,
 * `<Theme name="dark" />`, …). The GGPlot `theme` prop was removed in 0.13.0.
